### Features
- **Custom PCB Design**: Designed a custom PCB integrating MPU-6050 for precise motion tracking and other essential components.
- **Wi-Fi-Based Control**: Implemented remote control via ESP-12F microcontroller with real-time telemetry.
- **Advanced Algorithms**: Using PID for rate control and exploring Kalman filters for stabilization.
- **Hardware**: Optimized the design using SI2302DS MOSFET and integrated environmental sensors for future capabilities.
