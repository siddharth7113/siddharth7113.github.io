Hey there! I’m Siddharth, and I’m all about blending technology with curiosity to create impactful solutions. I’m currently pursuing dual degrees:

- **B.Tech in Information Technology & Mathematical Innovations** at the **[Cluster Innovation Centre, University of Delhi](https://cic.du.ac.in//)**
- **B.S in Data Science and Applications** at **[IIT Madras](https://onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/)**


I am also a **Volunteer Research Assistant** at the **[Financial Services Innovation Lab](https://fintech.gatech.edu/)** at **[Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/)**, where I contribute to cutting-edge research in Financial NLP models and data analysis.

In my free time ,I work on interesting software and hardware projects. Currently, I am working on **Micro-drones from scratch**. I wrote a blog about my journey
check it our here [**Dreaming about Drones**](/projects/micro_drones)

Some of the my personal past favourite projects include:

- Building **autonomous bots** that have won national-level competitions.
- Exploring machine learning techniques for **depression diagnosis**, combining my love for tech with real-world impact.
- **10-K Filing Analysis using Large Language Models (LLMs)**, diving into financial data to extract meaningful insights using AI.

[More projects can be found here.](/projects/) <!-- Replace '/projects/' with the actual link to your projects page -->

When I'm not knee-deep in code or research, you’ll probably find me exploring new tech tools, experimenting with drones, or contributing to open-source projects.

I’m always eager to learn something new, and I believe in the power of collaboration. If you’re as passionate about technology and problem-solving as I am, let’s connect and build something awesome together!

Feel free to check out my projects and drop me a line if you'd like to chat or collaborate on something cool.
