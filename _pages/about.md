# Website in Progress 

Hey there! I’m Siddharth, and I’m all about blending technology with curiosity to create impactful solutions. I’m currently pursuing dual degrees in **Information Technology & Mathematics** and **Data Science**, with a strong focus on **Machine Learning**, **IoT**, and **Autonomous Systems**.

By day, I work on cutting-edge research projects like developing **nano drones** and working on **financial NLP models**. I've also had the chance to be part of exciting projects such as:
- Building **autonomous bots** that have won national-level competitions.
- Exploring ways to use machine learning for **depression diagnosis**, combining my love for tech with real-world impact.
- **10-K Filing Analysis using Large Language Models** (LLMs), where I dive into financial data to extract meaningful insights using AI.

When I'm not knee-deep in code or research, you’ll probably find me exploring new tech tools, experimenting with drones, or contributing to open-source projects.

I’m always eager to learn something new, and I believe in the power of collaboration. If you’re as passionate about technology and problem-solving as I am, let’s connect and build something awesome together!

Feel free to check out my projects and drop me a line if you'd like to chat or collaborate on something cool.
