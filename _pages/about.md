Hey! Thanks for visiting my small corner on Interent. 

I am Siddharth, currently finishing my final year at **[Cluster Innovation Centre, University of Delhi](https://cic.du.ac.in//)**, I am majoring in **Computer Science & Mathematics with a minor in Computational Biology**. Fair warning: Iâ€™m still learning all of them.ðŸ˜…

I am also purusing **B.S. in Data Science and Applications** from  **[IIT Madras](https://onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/)** and recently finsihed my  **Diploma in Data Science** and on my way to finish **Diploma in Programming**. (If you are seeing this after August 2025, Feel free to [remind me](mailto:siddharth899@gmail.com)to update this page.
Thanks! 


I do a lot of different things in different domains. I try to maintain a list of major projects/works I am invovled in: 

- I am currently a [GSoC 2025 contributor](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/projects/5GJMolBG) along with 1279 other people and working on doing Climate Forecasting on publicly available data. This is an open project and if you want to contribute , here is the [link](https://github.com/openclimatefix/open-data-pvnet). I would be happy to help anyway I can. 

I have seen a lot of blogs publishing on how to *crack* GSoC, while there might be good advice in them. I do not share the same philoshopy with them, I don't this see them as an exam to be cracked but something you do out of pure sheer joy of contributing to **Open-Source**.
While I am still a novice in contributing to OSS, but I would be happy to help you get started or the very least share how I got started.

- I am also an [ESoC 2025 contributor](https://www.esoc.dev/) working on [**AI Drug development and Aptamer designing**](https://github.com/european-summer-of-code/esoc2025/blob/main/cards/aptamer.md),
As of July,2025 work is going, but we hope to make it openly-available, once complete.

- This summer I am part-time interning/helping a company to figure out a way to do solar generation forecasting. I am not sure how much details I can reveal, but it is interesting work!

- I am also a collabrator at [LossFunk](https://lossfunk.com/), where I work on my idea of **Genomic Foundation Models** about which I hope to publish soon, but this is my current top research interest and I am personally very bullish on **AI cell biology**.

- I am also a Volunteer Research Assistant at the [Financial Services Innovation Lab](https://fintech.gatech.edu/) at **Georgia Institute of Technology**, where I trying to contribute to cutting-edge work in Finance NLP (especially how LLMs react ins epcialised domain knowledge.) *We are hoping to publish something soon*.

- In my free time, which I am getting less and less!!, I love to work on hardware stuff and one of my long terms efforts have been building **Micro-drones from scratch**, I have written a blog when I started, you can find it here [Dreaming about Drones](/projects/micro_drones). I intend to write a part 2 soon,since there has been lot of progress and this project was initally funded by my *University* but nows run on the genorous micro-grants from individuals and orgs. 
To know more about the current state of the project,and help me keeping this ongoing. Feel free to email me.

After reading this, if you feel, this guy is involved in lot of projects, Well that is true, but I love working on stuff espeically if it involves solving real world problems with **Artifical Intelligence**, and I always up for interesting conversations.

I truly believe in the **power of collabration and interdiscplinary research**. I imagine them as working with different pieces of puzzle waiting to be connected together. 

[More projects can be found here.](/projects/) 
**Note:**  This page is still in progress. I have commendable people to who write regularly, I am trying to inculcate the habit but some may still remain incomplete,Please feel free to email me to learn more about them.

I also write regular blogs(atleast trying to be), about personal-cum-technical stuff, currently I think how AI (especially LLMs) are having personal effect on me as a developer as well learner.






*LLMs have not been used in generation or modification of the above content.*

<!-- When I'm not knee-deep in code or research, youâ€™ll probably find me exploring new tech tools, experimenting with drones, or contributing to open-source projects.

Iâ€™m always eager to learn something new, and I believe in the power of collaboration. If youâ€™re as passionate about technology and problem-solving as I am, letâ€™s connect and build something awesome together!

Feel free to check out my projects and drop me a line if you'd like to chat or collaborate on something cool. -->
